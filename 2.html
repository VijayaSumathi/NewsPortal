        <h6 style="font-size:200%;">What to do? </h6>
        <p style="font-size:150%;">
            <strong>Fresh Fruits and vegetables.</strong>It is a must to include fresh fruits and vegetables in your daily diet. Dehydration caused due to summer heat could cause loss of electrolytes. Feeling lethargic and nauseous could be symptoms of
            dehydration. Up your intake of fresh fruit and vegetables that are in season. Spruce it up in a way that your little fussy eaters would also look forward to having them. Vegetable chips, sandwiches, healthy soups, veggie lasagnas are some
            ways in which you can incorporate these healthy veggies.
        </p><br>
        <p style="font-size:150%;">
            <strong> Sauteed greens:</strong> Ditch oily and greasy for healthy saut&#233;ed greens. They are light, and packed with nutrients, antioxidants and vitamins you need to fight aliments such as high cholesterol, diabetes, and high blood pressure.
        </p><br>
        <p style="font-size:150%;">
            <strong> Load up on liquids, cold soups and sorbets:</strong> Kokum water, coconut water, chaas, fruit slushes and also frozen iced sorbets may prove to be the healthiest addition to your diet this scorching weather. These foods work well
            to restore electrolyte balance. According to experts, drinking 10-12 glasses of water is a must. Drinking infused water could also prove to be a good and healthy way to beat the heat. Another very effective way to beat the heat are soothing
            and fortifying cold soups. Load up on hearty cold soups that include gazpachos, cold cucumber soups, tomato soups for that full flavour and for that feeling of being full.

        <h6 style="font-size:200%;">What to Avoid? </h6>
        <p style="font-size:150%;">
            <strong> Check your protein intake:</strong> Proteins are the building blocks of life. You should definitely make sure you have enough of them each day. But make sure you do not overdo it. Especially in summers.Proteins are harder to digest
            in general and coupled with heat and dehydration, could leave you feeling uncomfortable and possibly nauseous if consumed in excess. The recommended daily intake of protein is one gram per kilo of ideal body weight (the appropriate weight
            for your height). So, no matter what you currently weigh, if your ideal body weight is supposed to be 57-58 kilos, your protein intake should not exceed 57-58 grams per day.
        </p><br>
        <p style="font-size:150%;">
            <strong> Avoid Alcohol:</strong> Try to cut down on your alcohol intake. Alcohol adds to more heat; alcohol is a vasodilator, which means that more blood gushes through your system leaving you feeling hotter and sweatier. Alcohol is also extremely
            dehydrating.
        </p><br>
        <p style="font-size:150%;">
            <strong> Check oily food intake:</strong> It becomes increasingly difficult for your body to expel all by-products of heavier, oilier foods through the kidney in summer, which is why urination is not as frequent when you are dehydrated. To
            counter this, the load of excreting oily food comes on to the skin - the second largest excretory organ - which will make you sweat more, dehydrate you further, kick-starting a vicious cycle.
